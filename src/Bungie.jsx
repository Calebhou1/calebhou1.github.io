    <h1>Rethinking Triumphs in Destiny 2</h1>
    <h2>By Caleb Hou</h2>
    <p>
      Hello there! I'm so excited and honored that you are viewing my little
      passion project. I've been one of Bungie's biggest fans since I've been 10
      years old, and Destiny has been a huge part of my life for the past 5
      years. I've made some of my closest friends through the game, and it's
      really gotten me through a lot. Working for Bungie has been a dream of
      mine, and I've spent the last 4 years of my career working on becoming a
      designer that you would want. While I don't necessarily have a lot of
      experience working in games, I am pretty good at design and I am a quick
      learner. I know that if you give me a chance to prove myself, I will show
      up every day, be excited, and make you guys proud. The project below
      contains my perspective on how I would enhance your already incredible
      game. Please enjoy, let me know if you have any questions, and thank you
      very much for your consideration!{" "}
