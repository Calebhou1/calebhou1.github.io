    <h1>Rethinking Triumphs in Destiny 2</h1>
    <h2>By Caleb Hou</h2>
    <div className="description">
      <p>
        Hello and thank you for viewing my design project. This project is an
        expression of my admiration of Destiny 2 from a player perspective as
        well as a view into my passion for thinking through user experience
        design problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my career of 10 years, Iâ€™ve worked on a wide variety of projects
        including mobile games, apps for Disney World, and websites for
        non-profit organizations. Across all these projects, my ultimate goal
        has remained the same: to bring enjoyment to users. In my current
        position as a Senior Product Designer at Disney, I'm working on a
        project that will help thousands of people get the most out of their
        experience at the parks, resorts, and cruise lines. And while my work is
        enjoyable, my passion for gaming has led me to seek a more meaningful
        position in UX design in games. I hope to use my skills at Bungie to
        contribute to the creation of memorable experiences for fellow gamers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is my perspective on the UX of the Triumph system in Destiny 2.
        This presentation exemplifies my capability for heuristic analysis,
        information architecture, persona development, and wire-framing with
        applicability to UX design in games. Thank you for your consideration.
      </p>
